# Notes

### 2023.7.10 Summer Session

* Bioinformatics focuses on 2 major problems:  

  1. *How we process the enormous bunch of data*;  
  2. *How we interpret the data to solve biological problems*;  

  The first one is more of a *"computer science"* issue,  
  while the later one having a tighter connection with biology.  


* The 3 steps of bioinformatics analysis
  1. Obtain information
  2. Setup a **Model**
  3. Apply an **Algorithm**

* **How to distinguish *"Model"* & *"Algorithm"* ?**  
  * **Model** presents the structure and result generated from applying a certain algorithm  
  * **Algorithm** involves how the specific processing of raw data is done
